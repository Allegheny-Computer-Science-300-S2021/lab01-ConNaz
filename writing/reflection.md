## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TO DO` with your response.

### First Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 dbSNP is a binoinformatics repisitory that was used in Covid19 research that stores relevant and critical discoveries in the genomics of the virus. Additionally, it is used to to "store and curate gene expression profiles". More speifically, it focuses on human SNP profiles and their interactions with Covid19. 
 
 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
This tool works as a government hosted database compiling great amounts of genomic research to be used in a sort of peer-reviewed process that consolidates revelevant discoveries to be further studied or utilized.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 This tool was neccesary to develop so that research could be stored and access in a more refined wasy, leading to great efficiency and a wider array of knowledge.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool? 
Knowledge is power for both good and bad people. In the same way genuine researchers may use this information to cure corona virus, bioterrorists can use the same information in harmful ways such as a bio-weapon, or even just intentionlly submitting faulty research that sets back the goals of others.


### Second Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
PredictSNP1 is a software used to predict the outcome of various genetic mutations related to disease.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This tool works by compiling previous research studies that are supported, and using this to create a concencus of likely outcomes related to amino acid mutations. A user of this database must enter a protein sequence into its search box, then the database will examine the sequence and will indicate likely amino acid mutations along with tools that can be used to evaluate the given sequence.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 This tool was neccesary to develop to aid scientists researching disease related protein sequences. Inserting sequences into this database helps to increase effeiciency as any known mutation will be identified alongside tools that can be used to futher examine the sample for specific traits.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool? 
 This method or tool could be missused in only a few ways that I can think of. One scenario that might happen is that someone could manipulate data for some sort of personal gain. Other than that it would be hard to use this prediction software malicously as far as I can see. Although unlikely, it could also help bioterrorists of the future stay a step ahead as what is known and predictable would be listed here for them to see.
